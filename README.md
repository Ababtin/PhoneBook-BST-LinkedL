# PhoneBook-BST-LinkedL
This Java-based Phonebook and Event Management System provides an efficient way to manage contacts, schedule events, and set up appointments. The system leverages a Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing and searching contacts, ensuring fast retrieval and management. It also incorporates a linked list structure to store events and appointments.

Features:
Contact Management: Add, search, update, and delete contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, address, and birthday.

Event Scheduling: Create and manage events with multiple contacts, including date, time, and location.

Appointment Scheduling: Schedule appointments linked to specific contacts.

Efficient Search & Retrieval: Supports searching by name, phone number, email, address, or birthday.

Data Structures Used:
BST for efficient contact management.
Linked Lists for handling event and appointment data.

User-Friendly CLI: A menu-driven console interface for easy interaction.

How to Run:
Compile all Java files.
Run the test.java file to start the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the system.


This project demonstrates the use of BSTs, linked lists, and object-oriented programming to build an interactive contact and event management system.
